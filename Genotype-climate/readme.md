#Analytical framework adopting Chen et al., 2022

The analyses are for three Asian horseshoe crab species 
The Mangrove horseshoe crab, CR
The Coastal horseshoe crab, TG
The Tri-spine horseshoe crab, TT

## Prepare allele frequency 
Allele frequency is calculated with PLINK v1.9 for individuals of each sampling site using "--keep" and "--freq"
We then collect all the ".frq" files to generate a allele frequency table using the R script ("freq_cal.r") attached.
